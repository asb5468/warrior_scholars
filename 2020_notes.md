* Spend less time on physics of LIGO and more time highlighting different applications of matched filtering
* Can save Gaussianity section for advanced students
* Don't mention the PSD if you're only going to talk about the ASD
* Include a visualization of the Welch method?
* Spend more time explaining the Welch method on real data than on generating colored Gaussian noise
* Use more analogies for the waveform effects:
  * Bigger rock thrown in lake, bigger ripples
  * Closer to the rock, bigger ripples
  * Save spin discussion for more advanced students?
* Mass ratio problem did not work well in zoom format. Maybe more time was needed, solving together on "white board"?
* More emphasis on concept behind cross-correlation than the mathematical procedure
